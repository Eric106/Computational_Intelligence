## Introduction

Networks and distributed processing systems have become an essential technology in any Enterprise Environment. The rapid growth of the amount of data that those environments have to deal has given rise to a depletion in expertise of human operators to manage them. A lot of efforts has gone into developing systems and protocols for collecting network traffic statistics. One of the approaches resarchers found was the ARIMA model.

An ARIMA model is a class of statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data.
ARIMA is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a generalization of the simpler AutoRegressive Moving Average and adds the notion of integration.

In this practice, the dataset analysis was made that includes the following attributes: 

`ts`, `uid`, `id_orig_h`, `id_orig_p`, `id_resp_h`, `id_resp_p`, `trans_depth`, `method`, `host`, `uri`, `referrer`, `user_agent`, `request_body_len`, `response_body_len`, `status_code`, `status_msg`, `info_code`, `info_msg`, `filename`, `tags`, `username`, `password`, `proxied`, `orig_fuids`, `orig_mime_types`, `resp_fuids`, `resp_mime_types`.

Our main goal is to run the ARIMA algorithm to this dataset in order to determine the performance and forecast differences between bayesian and classical inference models.
